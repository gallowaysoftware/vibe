# TODO

## ~~Installation path~~ (done)

`vibe doctor` is the entry point. It verifies binaries (`llama-server`,
`hf`), HuggingFace auth state, XDG dirs, ports `:9000` / `:9001`, profile
validity, MCP definitions, daemon reachability, and GPU presence. Each
check prints OK / WARN / FAIL; the command exits non-zero only on FAIL.

Still open from the original list: a one-shot binary install script
(`curl ... | sh` or `go install`) and a first-run "drop an example
profile in `~/.config/vibe/profiles/`" affordance.

## ~~MCP composition for profiles~~ (done)

Implemented: one YAML file per MCP under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vibe/mcp/`,
referenced from a profile via `frontend.mcps: [...]`. See
`profiles/mcp.example.yaml` and the Architecture section of the README.
